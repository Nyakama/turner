<p>We offer a variety of areas for graduates and placement students to utilise and develop their skills. Whether you relish the day-to-day challenges of project management, possess the precision and communication demands of project controls, appreciate the complexity of cost management or have the necessary strategic vision for advisory, the challenge is here for you to take.</p>
<h2>Graduate development programmeÂ </h2>
<p>Our Graduate development programme (GDP) is a structured learning environment providing graduates with the skills and experience they need to be successful. Over the two-year programme you will receive market-leading training through our technical training academy as well as on-the-job learning.</p>
<p>The GDP is blended with external qualifications and professional accreditation including <a href="https://www.rics.org/uk/">Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS)</a>, <a href="https://www.apm.org.uk/">Association For Project Management (APM)</a>, <a href="https://www.ciob.org/">Chartered Institute Of Building (CIOB)</a> and <a href="https://www.ice.org.uk/">Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE)</a> to ensure you become an industry leading professional. You will have all the tools and support you need to excel including a graduate development manager, central development team, line manager and buddy.</p>
<p>We offer our graduate programmes in a range of locations across the UK. We encourage you to be as mobile and as flexible as possible. Due to the nature of consultancy you will not necessarily be based in our office location and may need to visit and work from client sites.</p>
<p>We are currently taking applications for our 2023 Cost Management Programme. Please apply <a rel="noopener" href="https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/TurnerTownsend/743999890679183-graduate-programme-cost-management-2023" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Year placement</h2>
<p>We provide opportunities for university students to gain valuable industry experience during their degree and earn while they learn through a structured year-placement. Applicants should be completing a year in industry as part of their degree course. This placement is particularly suitable for those currently studying a built environment degree.</p>
<p>We are currently taking applications from RICS accredited students for placements in Quantity Surveying. Please apply <a rel="noopener" href="https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/TurnerTownsend/743999894930148-year-placement-quantity-surveying" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Summer placement</h2>
<p>We provide summer placements for students in their penultimate year at university but will consider those in their first year or second year of a four-year course. The placements usually start in June and will last 10-12 weeks, and are suitable for anyone wanting to gain an insight into the construction industry.</p>
<p>If you complete a placement with us, you will have the opportunity to fast-track on to another placement or directly on to the GDP. Your fast-track route will be determined by the amount of time you have left at university. If you are just returning for your final year, we will be able to fast-track you straight on to the GDP.</p>
