                <p><strong>Who will we share your personal information with?</strong></p>
<p>We will keep your personal information confidential and we will only share it where necessary for the purposes set out above with the following parties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Other companies in our Turner &amp; Townsend Group of companies.</li>
<li>Third parties who we have entered into contractual arrangements with to provide services we need to carry out our everyday business activities such as IT suppliers, website providers and Google Analytics.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="Section3"></a>3. What marketing activities do we carry out?</h2>
<p>We will use your personal information to provide you with marketing communications in the form of regional/global publications, newsletters, thought leadership pieces, apps usage, and information about and invites to events that we have organised (for example to corporate events, webinars and workshops) via email, telephone and social media which we think may be of interest to you or where you have expressly asked us to send to you.</p>
<p>We may at times conduct surveys, opinion polls or other sentiment collection methods via email, our Website and associated online platforms. Participants will be asked for personal data such as their email address and full name, job title, company and telephone number, in addition to opinions and feedback. This information will be used in the context of the survey and not for any other purposes, unless clearly stated.</p>
<p>You can opt-out of marketing communications at any time by contacting us using the details set out in <a href="#Section10" data-anchor="#Section10">section ten</a> below.</p>
<h2><a id="Section4"></a>4. How long do we keep personal information for?</h2>
<p>We will keep your personal information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes set out in <a href="#Section2" data-anchor="#Section2">section two</a> above, and to comply with any applicable privacy laws in the countries in which we operate. The exact time period will depend on your relationship with us and the type of personal information we hold about you.</p>
<p>When determining how long to retain your personal information, we will also take into consideration a number of factors including whether there are any existing contractual obligations we may owe you or you may owe us and whether there are anticipated or actual disputes, complaints or legal proceedings.</p>
<p>We have a retention policy in place which governs how long we will hold different types of information for. The exact time period will depend on your relationship with us and the type of personal information we hold and any legal obligations relating to the retention of personal data, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal information relating to prospective employees is kept for three years if the candidate provides their consent. If the candidate does not consent, then this information deleted from our systems after 30 days; and</li>
<li>Security information pertaining to our employees i.e. their name, security card details and which offices they have access are retained for seven years.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like further information regarding the periods for which your personal information will be stored, please contact us using the details set out <a href="#Section10" data-anchor="#Section10">section ten</a>.</p>
<h2><a id="Section5"></a>5. What is our approach to sending your personal information overseas</h2>
<p>As we are a global organisation, there will be instances where your personal information is transferred to countries outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA") namely because our group companies all use the same systems and we have intra-group reporting obligations. We may also transfer your personal information to third party suppliers who are based outside the EEA or when third parties who act on our behalf transfer your personal information to countries outside the EEA. Where such a transfer takes place, we will take the appropriate safeguarding measures to ensure that your personal information is adequately protected. We will do so in a number of ways including:</p>
<ul>
<li>entering into data transfer contracts and using specific contractual provisions that have been approved by European data protection authorities otherwise known as the "standard contractual clauses". Find out more about <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en" title="standard contractual clauses">standard contractual clauses</a>.;</li>
<li>transferring personal information only to companies in the United States who are certified under the "Privacy Shield". The Privacy Shield is a scheme whereby companies certify that they provide an adequate level of data protection. Find out more about the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome" title="Privacy Shield">Privacy Shield</a>; or</li>
<li>we will only transfer personal information to companies in non-EEA countries who have been deemed by European data protection authorities to have adequate levels of data protection for the protection of personal information. <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en" title="European data protection authorities">Find out more about this</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on our relationship and your particular circumstances, we might transfer personal information anywhere in the world. An example of our regular data transfers outside the EEA is set out below:</p>

<h2><a id="Section6"></a>6. How do we protect your information?</h2>
<p>We have a package of technical and organisational measures in place to protect your personal information which have been adopted to comply with the latest data protection requirements. The measures cover various aspects of data security including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>anti-virus, personal firewall and malware protection software;</li>
<li>access control regimes;</li>
<li>employee training and e-learning;</li>
<li>regular internal and external penetration testing and incident and disaster recovery planning;</li>
<li>use of firewalls which are reviewed on a frequent basis;</li>
<li>use of password protection; and</li>
<li>weekly and monthly scanning using industry standard vulnerability scanning tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our security measures are kept under periodic review and are regularly updated to reflect developments in technology and security and changes to our business.</p>
<h2><a id="Section7"></a>7. Profiling and automated decision making</h2>
<p>We do not carry out any automated decision making or profiling activities.</p>
<h2><a id="Section8"></a>8. Your rights</h2>
<p>Under data protection laws you have a number of rights in relation to the personal information that we hold about you which we set out below. These rights might not apply in every circumstance. You can exercise your rights by contacting us at any time using the details set out in <a href="#Section10" data-anchor="#Section10">section ten</a>. We will not usually charge you in relation to a request.</p>
<p>Please note that although we take your rights seriously, there may be some circumstances where we cannot comply with your request such as where complying with it would mean that we couldn't comply with our own legal or regulatory obligations. In these instances we will let you know why we cannot comply with your request.</p>
<p><strong>The right to access your personal information</strong></p>
<p>You are entitled to a copy of the personal information we hold about you and certain details about how we use it.</p>
<p>We will usually provide your personal information to you in writing unless you request otherwise. Where your request has been made electronically (e.g. by email), a copy of your personal information will be provided to you by electronic means where possible.</p>
<p><strong>The right to rectification</strong></p>
<p>We always take care to ensure that the information we hold about you is accurate and where necessary up to date. If you believe that there are any inaccuracies, discrepancies or gaps in the information we hold about you, you can contact us and ask us to update or amend it.</p>
<p><strong>The right to restriction of processing</strong></p>
<p>In certain circumstances, you are entitled to ask us to stop using your personal information, for example where you think that the personal information we hold about you may be inaccurate or where you think that we no longer need to use your personal information.</p>
<p><strong>The right to withdraw your consent</strong></p>
<p>Where we rely on your consent in order to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw such consent to further use of your personal information.</p>
<p><strong>The right to erasure</strong></p>
<p>This is sometimes known as the 'right to be forgotten'. It entitles you, in certain circumstances, to request deletion of your personal information. For example, where we no longer need your personal information for the original purpose we collected it for or where you have exercised your right to withdraw consent.</p>
<p>Whilst we will assess every request, there are other factors that will need to be taken into consideration. For example we may be unable to erase your information as you have requested because we have a legal or regulatory obligation to keep it.</p>
<p><strong>The right to object</strong></p>
<p>In certain cases, you have the right to object to our processing. This arises in relation to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marketing: You have control over the extent to which we market to you and you have the right to request that we stop sending you marketing messages at any time. You can do this either by clicking on the "unsubscribe" button in any email that we send to you or by contacting us using the details set out in <a href="#Section10" data-anchor="#Section10">section ten</a>. Please note that even if you exercise this right because you do not want to receive marketing messages, we may still send you service related communications where necessary.</li>
<li>Processing based on our justifiable purpose: Where we process your personal information on the basis of a justifiable purpose, you can object to such processing, unless our purpose outweighs any prejudice to your privacy rights.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The right to data portability</strong></p>
<p>In certain circumstances, you can request that we transfer personal information that you have provided to us directly to a third party.</p>
<p><strong>Rights relating to automated decision-making</strong></p>
<p>We do not carry out any automated decision-making. If this changes, we will let you know and inform you of your rights relating to automated decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>The right to make a complaint to the ICO</strong></p>
<p>You have a right to complain to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) if you believe that we have breached data protection laws when using your personal information.</p>
<p>Visit the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/" title="ICO">ICO's website</a> for more information. Please note that lodging a complaint will not affect any other legal rights or remedies that you have.</p>
